Project Management Application (PMA)

Overview

This repository showcases the Project Management Application (PMA) developed as a semester-long team project for university. The PMA was designed to streamline project collaboration, integrate user roles with varying access levels, and support cloud storage for file uploads. The project adheres to a set of base and extended requirements while providing opportunities for customization and thematic enhancements.

My Roles

As Scrum Master and Lead UI Designer, I was responsible for:
